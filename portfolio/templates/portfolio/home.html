        <p class="lead mb-3">In my last year at primary school, the first PC appeared and I was fascinated. As part of an elite team of like-minded individuals (nerds, some might say), we set out to master this new technology -  as well as being responsible for removing and replacing the dust cover at the start and end of each day! By the time I left college, computers were everywhere.</p>
        <p class="lead mb-3">I enjoyed a 20 year long career in retail, culminating in owning my own video-game shop specializing in retro games, Ninja Game Den.</p>
        <p class="lead mb-3">I've also immersed myself in learning to code with an ongoing goal of becoming a full-stack web developer. Now in my 30's I still say that's what I want to be when I grow up!</p>
        <p class="lead mb-3">This is partly a portfolio of my experience and learning, in particular the self-directed kind, which I don't have certificates for. And it is also a learning process, under constant development as I discover new technologies and gain new skills. I built it using Python's Django Web-Framework - currently there's more going on behind the scenes than there is out front!</p>
        <p class="lead mb-5">If you're learning to code too, then check out my blog where I'll recommend lots of resources that have helped me. If you want to know if I can help you or your organisation then read on or get in touch!</p>

            <p>After Gamestar closed in 2017 I re-established the store as a new company, Ninja Game Den Ltd.</p>
            <p>My responsibilities included administration, finance, marketing, human resources and customer service.</p>
            <p>I created the company website using WordPress and the Woo Commerce plugin. I also created stock management software in Python (see my <a href="https://github.com/robertmalyon">GitHub</a> for full details!).</p>
            <p>I built display cabinets and remodelled the counter too!</p>

            <p>My role involved lots of customer service and progressed to also include hiring and managing staff, creating rotas, finance and book-keeping, co-ordinating activities between branches and managing on-line sales through the Amazon marketplace.</p>

        <p>When I'm not in front of a computer, I have a strong interest in DIY and building things. I've taken on lots of projects at home including building stud walls, redecorating every room multiple times and lots of gardening. I have undertaken quite a large garden landscaping project involving excavating many tons of soil and then bulding a large decking area with pergola and a retaining wall followed by levelling and returfing the rest of the garden.</p>
        <p>I'm always fixing things including small gadgets like mobile-phones as well as large appliances like our tumble drier, washing machine and everything in-between.</p>
        <p>I love reading, both physical books and audiobooks. I also enjoy listening to podcasts. My favourite book is probably The Count of Monte Cristo, which I've read more times than I can remember and regularly quote, much to everyones annoyance!</p>
        <p>I play videogames, mainly retro. I like to cook. I like going on long walks with my dogs (and my audiobooks/podcasts).</p>
        <p class="mb-0">Most of all I love spending time with my wife and four children.</p>
